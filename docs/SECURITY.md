# Security Measures and Best Practices

## Authentication & Authorization

1. **JWT Implementation**
   - Tokens are signed using HS256 algorithm
   - Token expiration set to 24 hours
   - Refresh token mechanism implemented
   - Token blacklisting for logout

2. **Password Security**
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - Minimum password length: 8 characters
   - Password complexity requirements:
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Teacher role: Can manage courses, attendance, grades
   - Student role: Can view their own attendance and grades
   - Admin role: Full system access

## API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented using Redis
   - 100 requests per minute per IP
   - 1000 requests per hour per user

2. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs validated using Pydantic models
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - Only allowed origins can access the API
   - Pre-flight requests handled
   - Credentials included in requests

## Data Security

1. **Database Security**
   - Connection pooling
   - Prepared statements
   - Regular backups
   - Data encryption at rest

2. **File Upload Security**
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   - Virus scanning
   - Secure storage

3. **Session Management**
   - Secure cookie settings
   - Session timeout
   - Concurrent session control

## Monitoring & Logging

1. **Security Logging**
   - Login attempts
   - Failed authentication
   - Access to sensitive data
   - System changes

2. **Error Handling**
   - Generic error messages
   - No stack traces in production
   - Error logging with context

## Deployment Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Different values for different environments
   - Regular rotation of secrets

2. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS only
   - Firewall configuration
   - DDoS protection

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Security patches
   - Dependency updates
   - Vulnerability scanning

## Security Headers

```python
# Example security headers configuration
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'",
    "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

## Regular Security Tasks

1. **Daily**
   - Monitor security logs
   - Check for failed login attempts
   - Review access patterns

2. **Weekly**
   - Update dependencies
   - Review security alerts
   - Backup verification

3. **Monthly**
   - Security audit
   - Password rotation
   - Access review

4. **Quarterly**
   - Penetration testing
   - Security training
   - Policy review
